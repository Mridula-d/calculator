# 🧮 Simple Calculator (Python)

This is a **modular Python-based calculator** that performs basic arithmetic operations. Each operation is implemented as a separate module for better readability, scalability, and maintainability. The program runs in the terminal/console and allows the user to repeatedly perform calculations until they choose to exit.

## 🚀 Features

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Modulus (remainder)
* Power (exponentiation)
* Square Root
* Exit option
